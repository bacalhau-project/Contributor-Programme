# Expanso Contributor Programme
Information and links on how to get involved in the Expanso Contributor Programme.

## What is the Expanso Contributor Programme?

Through the Expanso Contributor Programme, we invite anybody who would like to publish technical content about Bacalhau - whether it be blogs, workshops or thought leadership - to reach out to us with their ideas, collaborate with us on the piece, and publish it across our network and platforms.

You can find out more [here](https://expanso.io).

## How does it work?

We like to keep things simple, so we’ve set up a standard process for everyone to follow and get involved.

1. Get some inspiration from our Blogs, and Case Studies.

2. Check out our Contributor Programme repo on GitHub to see what kinds of content we're interested in right now.

3. Decide on an idea, and pitch it to us through our [Google Form](https://forms.gle/mu1WMxFKiYSB36eZ7).

4. We'll review the idea, and if we like it, we'll reach out to you to start collaborating.

5. Kick-off session: We'll schedule a call to talk through your idea, what we'd like to see, and a timeline for when it'll be finished.

6. Check-in session: We'll sync a week or so after kick-off to see how you're doing, and if we can help you in any way.

7. Hand-in: You send over the content, and we'll schedule it for distribution on our blogs and social media channels.

8. We pay you!

## What we've created, and what we'd love to see right now

To help kick you off and hopefully spark some ideas in you, here’s a few things we’ve published recently that we’re really proud of:

- How to Save 95% on Log Processing with Bacalhau and MotherDuck ([blog](https://blog.bacalhau.org/p/how-to-save-95-on-log-processing))

- Convert CSV To Parquet Or Avro ([tutorial](https://docs.bacalhau.org/examples/data-engineering/index-2))

- Deploy a Multi-region ETL Pipeline with Bacalhau for MongoDB ([workshop](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/examples/tree/main/case-studies/mongodb-atlas))

- Running Stable Diffusion on the Bacalhau Network ([tutorial](https://docs.bacalhau.org/examples/model-inference/index-4))

- Generate Realistic Images using StyleGAN3 and Bacalhau ([tutorial](https://docs.bacalhau.org/examples/model-inference/index-6))

- Integrating Bacalhau with MotherDuck ([workshop](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/examples/tree/main/case-studies/motherduck-bacalhau-integration))

- Running OCR with Bacalhau ([Notebook](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/examples/blob/main/model-inference/EasyOCR/index.ipynb))

**And these are kind of things we’d love to see right now:**

- Using Bacalhau to deploy and interact with EdgeML models

- Deploying Private Clusters through CDKs + IaC

- Managing workloads across unreliable networks

- Managing data from different Cloud services with Bacalhau

But, if you have a great idea, and it doesn’t quite fit into those areas, *[tell us about it anyway!](https://forms.gle/mu1WMxFKiYSB36eZ7)* We love to hear from people who’ve had great ideas and want to share them with the world.

## Guidelines and Best Practices

In order to guarantee the success of the Expanso Contributor Programme, we have some guidelines and best practices to govern submissions and content:

- **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on creating high quality deliverables. While there are benefits to having a great volume of content, we firmly believe that the quality of a piece is measured not in its size, but in the learnings conveyed in it. If you need extra time or help to work on the piece, let us know.

- **Talk to us**: If you get stuck, encounter any issues or need a helping hand, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We’re here to help, and we want to help you put together the best piece of content we can.

- **Stick to the Timeline**: We like to move fast here at Expanso, but we also like to keep our output as consistent as possible. In the kick-off session, we’ll agree a timeline to work to, with established check-in points. Ideally, the pieces are focussed, get straight to the point, and shouldn’t take more than a week or so to put together. If you need an extension, let us know as quickly as possible, and we’ll do everything we can to make that happen.

- **Collaborate and Learn**: Engage with other contributors, share insights, and learn from each other. The Bacalhau community thrives on collaboration and your contributions will add to its strength.
